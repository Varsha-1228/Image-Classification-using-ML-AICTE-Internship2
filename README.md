# Image-Classification-using-ML-AICTE-Internship2
A machine learning project demonstrating how to build, train, and evaluate an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras. This project explores concepts in deep learning, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images into predefined categories using CIFAR-10 Dataset.

# Features

Custom Dataset Support: Easily integrate custom datasets in addition to standard datasets like CIFAR-10 and MNIST.
Model Architecture: Modular and flexible CNN implementation for experimentation and tuning.
Training and Validation: Includes functionality to split data, monitor performance metrics, and adjust hyperparameters.
Visualization Tools: Visualize training metrics (accuracy and loss), predictions, and intermediate feature maps.

# Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy

# Setup

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Install Jupyter Notebook if you'd like to run the project in an interactive environment: pip install notebook

# Usage

Training the Model
Run the training script to build and train the model: python train_model.py

Evaluating the Model
After training, evaluate the model using the test dataset: python evaluate_model.py

Visualizing Results
To visualize training metrics or sample predictions, use the provided notebooks: jupyter notebook

# Datasets

CIFAR-10: A dataset of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.

# Results

Sample results include:

Accuracy: Achieved [XX]% on CIFAR-10.
Loss Curves: Training and validation loss converge smoothly.
Predictions: Model correctly classifies most test images.

# Future Improvements

Add support for transfer learning with pre-trained models (e.g., ResNet, MobileNet).
Implement data augmentation techniques for better generalization.
Integrate hyperparameter optimization tools.
